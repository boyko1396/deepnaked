          <p>Our cutting-edge machine learning technology leverages two distinct algorithms, Algorithm V1 and Algorithm V2, each utilizing unique training image sets. By employing both V1 and V2, users can achieve the best possible outcome when processing their images. It is highly recommended to compare and analyze the results obtained from both versions to ensure optimal results.</p>
          <p>We would like to highlight that our free plan preview exclusively employs the version 1 A.I. prior to the application adding blur. This advanced algorithm, developed through deepfake and deepnude AI technology, is designed to enhance the accuracy and realism of image processing.</p>
          <p>V1 demonstrates remarkable capabilities in accurately predicting the size of subjects with average to small breasts. Additionally, it showcases superior performance when dealing with individuals possessing fair to dark skin tones. These features make it an ideal choice for users seeking exceptional results in these specific areas.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, V2 has been meticulously trained to excel in predicting the size of subjects with average to larger breasts. It exhibits superior performance when processing images of individuals with fair to light skin tones. Moreover, V2 showcases its strength in handling images that may be considered challenging due to their quality or non-compliance with the recommended upload guidelines.</p>
